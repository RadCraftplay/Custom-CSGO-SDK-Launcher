    <Text>What are migration conflicts?
Migration conflicts occur when you roll back to an older version of Custom SDK Launcher, and then go back again to the same, or newer version. Another case migration conflicts might happen is when you restore backup from older versions. Some filenames change in some versions of Custom SDK Launcher.

For example:
In version 4.0 file profiles.xml was renamed to games.xml. If you restore backup from older version of Custom SDK Launcher, after restart CSDKL, migration conflict dialog will be displayed</Text>
